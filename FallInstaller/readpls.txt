Guys:

To make an installer for the game you need to...

1.  Make an executable of the game called PaperCut.exe
2.  Take it and its data folder and put them into GAMEDIRECTORY.  If this folder doesn't exist, make a new one and call it that
3.  Open InstallScript and Build->Compile (or press Ctrl + F9)
4.  Your fresh-baked loaf of installer will be in the INSTALLER folder
